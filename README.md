# bloom

A simple implementation of [Bloom filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter),
implemented in variety of languages I'm currently using.

Tests pass, so hypothetically production-ready, but there are likely many
better options in each language you should use.

This is mostly a learning experience for me, as I haven't done much data
structures work lately & needed to stretch my legs. Feel free to learn along
with me!

## Tests

Python: `$ pipenv install & pipenv run pytest`
JS: `$ npm i & node tests/test_bloom.js`
Typescript: `$ npm i & node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js`
